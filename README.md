## Purpose
This analysis is to quantitatively assess the geometry of dykes. We are using a case study with dykes from Argentina, however given a similar data input, it should be usable to analyse field data.
In detail: segment length, segment thickness, (tip geometry), (segment overlap), (segment relay zones),...
NB! Parameters in brakets are not implemented yet.
